                            In a machine learning course at Shenandoah Valley Governor's School, I created
                            the Break Point Predictor for competitive bowlers. With the donation of an extensive 
                            research dataset from the Professional Bowlers Association, I implemented an XGBoost 
                            gradient boost algorithm to guess where the optimal location to bowl a strike is.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Break Point Predictor takes the input of a few key details about a given shot to determine
                            the length of the oil pattern. The point where the oil stops on a boling lane is called the 
                            break point because it is where the hooking bowling balls will 'break' towards the pins. 
                            The algorithm is able to accurately estimate the break point within a foot 
                            from the actual length of the oil. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The goal of this project was to balance accuracy with ease of use for bowlers without the 
                            ability to find precise data measurements. With that in mind, the Break Point Predictor went
                            above and beyond what I thought was possible. The success of this project earned the Best in 
                            Machine Learning Award from Shenandoah Valley Governor's School.

                    Art has been a long-time hobby of mine. Over the years, I have complete several recerational
                    and semi-professional projects. I have created both physical and graphic designs that were
                    comissioned by people.

                    Film making and editing has been a hobby of mine for several years. Most recently, I had the 
                    opportunity to work with a few of my peers to create a professional video. The prompt was
                    to analyze and implement viral video-making techniques to engage a viewer and convey a message.
                    Our group decided to focus on bowling, specifially how a beginner can learn to start getting 
                    higher scores. My job was to orgainze the content and edit the video. Our group's submission 
                    was a huge success gathering nearly quadrouple the amount  of views of the second place 
                    sumbission.

                    Working with my church, I was able to do a lot of community outreach. I got the opprotunity to 
                    travel and help others in need.

                        <li>I traveled to Alaska where we did crafts, handed out free sandwiches, and conversated

                        <li>I traveled to West Virginia where we aided the flood victims in 2016. We helped prepare
                            homes for rennovation, cleaned up trash, and offered free supplies to those in the 
                            community.

                    I have been bowling competitvely for eight years in leagues and prize tournaments. Thoughout
